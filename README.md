# toy_dash

This is my playground for playing with Dash in Python. :) 

Most toy dash here are created based on Dash Docs available at [dash.plotly.com](https://dash.plotly.com/). Other relevant sources are cited in each individual app. 

Use `pipenv` to reproduce the environment if you would like to play with these apps. :)
