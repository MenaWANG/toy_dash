Tools like Plotly Dash can be very useful for data scientists. We can use them to create interactive web applications and dashboards, enable our stakeholders to consume analytical insights in a user-friendly and intuitive way.

This repo is my playground for playing with Plotly Dash. Each `.py` file is a simple Dash App that demos one particular dash functionality that I find helpful. 

Most toy dash apps here are created based on Dash Docs available at [dash.plotly.com](https://dash.plotly.com/). Other relevant sources are cited in each individual apps. 

Use `pipenv` and the pipfile in the repo to reproduce the environment if you would like to play with these apps too. Have fun! :)
